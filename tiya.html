		<p>Scratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children 8–16 as an educational tool for programming.
        
        
        Users on the site, called Scratchers, can create projects on the web using a block-like interface. Projects can be exported to HTML5, Android apps and EXE files using external tools.
        
        
        The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world.[8] Scratch is taught and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions. As of July 2021, community statistics on the language's official website show more than 82 million projects shared by over 74 million users, and more than 73 million monthly website visits.
        
        Scratch takes its name from a technique used by disk jockeys called "scratching", where vinyl records are clipped together and manipulated on a turntable to produce different sound effects and music. Like scratching, the website lets users mix together different media (including graphics, sound, and other programs) in creative ways by creating and remixing projects, like video games, animations, and simulations.The Scratch interface is divided into three main sections: a stage area, block palette, and a coding area to place and arrange the blocks into scripts that can be run by pressing the green flag or clicking on the code itself. Users may also create their own code blocks and they will appear in "My Blocks".


The Scratch 3.0 development environment on startup.
The stage area features the results (e.g., animations, turtle graphics, either in a small or normal size, with a full-screen option also available) and all sprites thumbnails being listed in the bottom area. The stage uses x and y coordinates, with 0,0 being the stage center.[11]

With a sprite selected at the bottom of the staging area, blocks of commands can be applied to it by dragging them from the block palette into the coding area. The Costumes tab allows users to change the look of the sprite in order to create various effects, including animation.[11] The Sounds tab allows attaching sounds and music to a sprite.[12]

When creating sprites and also backgrounds, users can draw their own sprite manually,[11] choose a Sprite from the library, or upload an image.[12]

The table below shows the categories of the programming blocks:</p>
